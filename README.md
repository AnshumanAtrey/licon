## 🧑‍💻 **How Licon Works**

- Scrolls to the bottom of the page
- Clicks "Show more results" until it's gone
- Clicks each visible **Connect** button
- Waits for the modal and clicks **Send without a note**
- Repeats until all visible people are invited

---

> **Notes:**
> - Licon only connects with people currently visible on the "People" tab of a company.
> - It does **not** send duplicate invites or connect with people already connected.

---

## 🧭 **Planned Features**

- Custom note messaging
- AI-based invite personalization
