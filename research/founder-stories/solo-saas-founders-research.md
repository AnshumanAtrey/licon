| 17 | Andy Cloke | Data Fetcher | $23K MRR | Was one of the FIRST extensions on Airtable's marketplace = prime positioning. 70-80% of customers come from marketplace organic placement. YouTube tutorials with only 8 views still convert customers. | Platform marketplace first-mover |
| 18 | Rick Blyth | Merch Wizard | $500K+ total, exited | Chrome extensions run client-side = near-zero infrastructure costs (70-80% margins). Built free tools first to collect emails, then sold paid version to warm audience. Sold on Empire Flippers in 5 HOURS. | Free tools -> email list -> paid |
| 19 | Adriaan van Rossum | Simple Analytics | $500K/yr | Privacy-first positioning perfectly timed with GDPR + Cambridge Analytica backlash.

## Detailed Profiles

---

### 1. Pieter Levels -- PhotoAI + Portfolio ($3M+/year)

**Location:** Netherlands (digital nomad)
**Age:** Mid-30s
**Background:** Self-taught developer. Learned to code in his late 20s through making electronic music mixes on YouTube. Failed at 70+ projects before finding success.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Pieter's USP is ruthless speed and volume. He ships products in 2 weeks and demands credit card payment immediately. His tech stack (PHP, jQuery, SQLite) deploys in 1-2 seconds. He made 37,000 git commits in 12 months. Instead of hiring, he automates everything with GPT-4 (content moderation, customer onboarding, spam detection). His portfolio approach means if one product dies, others sustain him. Only 4 out of 70+ projects ever made money -- but those 4 make $3M/year.

**Products & Revenue:**
- PhotoAI: $132K/month (AI headshot/photo generation)
- RemoteOK: $41K/month (remote job board)
- InteriorAI: $40K/month (AI interior design)
- NomadList + others: $15-22K/month each

**How He Found Paying Users:**
- AvatarAI (predecessor to PhotoAI) made ~$150K in its first WEEK
- PhotoAI launched Feb 2023, hit $100K/month by Sept 2024
- 50% of traffic from organic search
- One TikTok video generated $20K extra/month
- Lex Fridman podcast appearance was a massive catalyst

**Tech Stack:** PHP, jQuery, SQLite. Deploys in 1-2 seconds.

**Pricing:** $29/month for 1,000 generated images. Annual subscriptions at discount.

**Key Quote:** "Only 4 out of 70+ projects I ever did made money. >95% of everything I ever did failed."

---

### 2. Tony Dinh -- TypingMind ($137K/month)

**Location:** Vietnam (previously Singapore)
**Background:** Vietnamese software engineer, 7 years at Zendesk. Started coding in high school with Visual Basic 6.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Tony built TypingMind in ONE DAY when OpenAI's API launched. The BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model was the killer differentiator -- users control their own API costs and aren't locked into a subscription that might not match their usage. He was literally the first person to make ChatGPT's interface usable. Speed-to-market was the entire strategy.

**Products & Revenue:**
- TypingMind: $137K/month (97K+ from 20,000+ customers)
- Previously: DevUtils ($9 one-time macOS tool), BlackMagic (sold for $128K), Xnapper (sold)

**How He Found Paying Users:**
- Launched within 5 days of OpenAI's API announcement
- $10K revenue in first 10 days from organic X/Twitter sharing
- 97K Twitter followers became his distribution engine
- Each successful product built audience for the next launch
- Zero paid ads ever

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Sept 2020: First sale ($9 for DevUtils on Hacker News)
- Aug 2021: Quit job with $500/month MRR + 8K Twitter followers
- Mar 2023: Launched TypingMind, $10K in 10 days
- Sept 2024: ~$45K/month
- Current: $137K/month

**Tech Stack:** TypingMind is a static web app with no backend/database initially (minimal hosting costs). Payments via Lemon Squeezy (experienced 1,300% MRR increase after switching from Gumroad).

**Pricing:** Started at $9 one-time, progressively raised to $39. Hybrid model: one-time for core + subscriptions ($15K MRR) for cloud sync/team features.

**His Advice:** "Practice shipping products more frequently to build muscle memory." His first project took 6 months with 95% test coverage and was abandoned. Successful products launched with zero test cases.

**Lifestyle:** Now works ~4 hours/day, spends half his waking hours surfing and at the gym.

### 3. Danny Postma -- HeadshotPro ($300K/month, $3.6M ARR)

**Location:** Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (previously Bali)
**Age:** 29
**Background:** Dutch. Started as a web marketer, learned to code at 25. 87K Twitter followers.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Danny's USP is his SEO-FIRST product development methodology. He only builds products where keyword difficulty is under 10-20 on Ahrefs. He validates the marketing channel BEFORE writing code. When Lensa/Remini went viral, his existing SEO positioning captured the demand surge automatically -- sales tripled without him doing anything. His affiliate program ($50K+/month) essentially pays other people to market for him.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Previously sold Headlime (AI copywriting) for $1,000,000 at $20K MRR
- Mar 2023: HeadshotPro launched, six figures in first week
- 2024-2025: $300K/month, $3.6M ARR
- Portfolio (Postcrafts): ~20 live projects

**How He Found Paying Users:**
1. Keyword research on Ahrefs BEFORE building anything
2. Bought domain HeadshotPro.com specifically for Google relevance
3. Also acquired profilepicturemaker.com (12-year-old domain) for SEO authority
4. Programmatic SEO: Generated 200+ pages for different cities/counties
5. Affiliate program: 30% commission, 60-day cookie, managed via Rewardful
6. Product Hunt for initial visibility and backlinks

**Tech Stack:** Stable Diffusion models (evolved to SDXL and Diffusion Transformers). High-end GPUs + cloud infrastructure.

**Pricing:** One-time purchases (NOT subscriptions). Basic $29 (40 headshots), Professional $39 (100), Executive $59 (150).

**Key Insight:** "If people are already buying something like this or searching for it, they'll have budget for yours." He built an earlier product (Deep Agency) that got 30M impressions but death threats from photographers and minimal sales.

---

### 4. Yasser Elsaid -- Chatbase ($8M+ ARR)

**Location:** Canada (originally Egypt)
**Age:** 24 at launch
**Background:** Final year at York University. Interned at Meta and Tesla. Did NOT receive Meta return offer -- later called it "the best thing that ever happened."

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Yasser started experimenting with GPT-3 API TWO MONTHS before ChatGPT launched publicly. He was first to productize RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) as a consumer product. Reached $1M ARR in 117 days. The viral moment: tweeted the launch to his 16 Twitter followers. The tweet went viral, servers crashed twice in 24 hours. He failed two university classes because he went all-in when he saw traction.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Feb 7, 2023: $0 (launch day, 16 Twitter followers)
- Feb 11: $400
- Feb 28: $3,000
- Mar 15: $10,000 MRR
- May 2023: $64,000 MRR
- Feb 2024: $3M ARR
- Dec 2024: $390K MRR (missed his $1M MRR goal)
- Early 2026: $8M+ ARR, 18 employees

**How He Found Paying Users:**
- Launch tweet went viral organically
- AI influencer Rowan Cheung (The Rundown AI) featured it
- Product Hunt, Reddit, AI tool directories
- No paid advertising in early stages
- Product itself was viral -- people wanted to show they could chat with documents

**Tech Stack:** React, Next.js, Supabase (saved 100-150 hours), OpenAI API, LangChain, Pinecone (vector DB). MVP built in 60 days.

**Unit Economics:** 90% gross margins. 92% customer retention.

**Pricing:** Free (limited), Hobby $40/mo, Standard $150/mo, Pro $500/mo, Enterprise custom.

**Key Learning:** "Hiring is extremely hard. Competence is a scarce resource and common sense is not very common." His biggest mistake: "acting like a bootstrapped founder" when the business demanded investment in scaling.

### 5. Maor Shlomo -- Base44 ($80M exit in 6 months)

**Location:** Israel (Haifa)
**Age:** 31
**Background:** Former Data Science leader at IDF Unit 8200 (won Israel Defense Prize). Co-founded Explorium, raised $50M+, managed 100-person team for 7 years. Severe ADHD -- worked 17-hour days forgetting to eat.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Base44 hit $1M ARR in just 3 WEEKS. AI wrote ~90% of his code via Cursor. A counterintuitive move -- REMOVING a "helpful" feature -- tripled activation rates. Pre-acquisition profit was $189K/month on $200K revenue (95% margins). He owned 100% of shares at the $80M Wix acquisition. Built during active wartime, signed the deal as missiles from Iran were flying.

**Origin Story:**
After serving in reserves following Oct 7, 2023, tried building a friend's tattoo business website in WordPress. Found it frustratingly difficult. Realized AI could simplify software creation entirely.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Feb 2025: Launch
- 3 weeks post-launch: $1M ARR
- 1 month: $1.5M cumulative
- Pre-acquisition (May 2025): $200K/month, 350,000 users
- June 2025: Acquired by Wix for $80M cash

**How He Found Paying Users:**
- Shared build process daily on LinkedIn (radical transparency)
- Organized hackathons, built WhatsApp groups with thousands of users
- Product Hunt launch triggered bot-attack detection (too much traffic)
- First paying customer: a jeweler who sent $100 unsolicited
- Zero dollars on paid marketing

**Tech Stack:** Claude Sonnet 4 + Gemini 2.5 Pro (intelligently switches), MongoDB, Render, Cloudflare. Used Cursor extensively.

**Pricing:** $20-$200/month subscription tiers. Simple B2C model avoided enterprise sales cycles.

---

### 6. Marc Lou -- ShipFast + Portfolio ($1.03M in 2025)

**Location:** Bali, Indonesia
**Background:** French. Got fired from Tai Lopez's company in Nov 2021 with $20K savings and "bad coding skills." Spent years in depression building failed products. Built 28 startups before his breakthrough.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Marc doesn't sell SaaS -- he sells the BOILERPLATE every SaaS needs. ShipFast packages the boring-but-essential setup (auth, payments, email, SEO) as a one-time $199 purchase. His real moat is his personal brand and cross-product flywheel across 20+ products. Total infrastructure costs: ~$63/month for 21 apps on Vercel. 91% profit margins at $65K/month with 0 employees.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Dec 2021 - Mid 2022: A few hundred dollars/month
- July 2023: ~$3K/month across 8 startups
- Sept 2023: Launched ShipFast, $40K in first month
- Nov 2023: $65.4K/month at 91% margins
- 2025: $1,032,000 total

**Products:** ShipFast ($199 one-time), CodeFast (coding course ~$14K/mo), DataFast (analytics ~$15K/mo), TrustMRR (now earning more than his three main products combined).

**Marketing:**
- Twitter/X: Grew from 1K to 55K followers through consistent shipping
- YouTube: Founder-story videos, revenue spikes coincide with viral videos
- "Side-project marketing": Ships free tools to promote paid products
- Newsletter: 7K readers
- Sold underperforming products (MakeLanding for $35K + others for $45K)

**Lifestyle:** Lives on ~$1K/month in Bali despite making $1M+/year. Prioritizes surfing, health, sleep.

---

### 7. Damon Chen -- Testimonial.to + PDF.ai (~$3M combined)

**Location:** USA
**Background:** Cisco network engineer for 8 years ("mediocre" engineer). Made his wife a promise: reach $100K income in 1 year or go back to corporate. Before Testimonial.to, generated $1.99 total across 4 failed products.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Two killer moves: (1) Reused 80% of code from his FAILED project IndieLog to build Testimonial.to in 3 weeks. (2) Domain arbitrage -- bought PDF.ai for $20K with $0 revenue, grew to $591K/year. Bought testimonials.io for $35K, made $80K just from people mistyping the URL. Product-led growth loop: free testimonial walls display Testimonial.to logo, visitors see it and sign up.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Dec 2020: Built MVP in 3 weeks (80% code reused from failed project)
- Launch: 30 lifetime deals at $199 = $6K in 2 weeks
- Mar 2021: $1K MRR, quit Cisco
- Sept 2021: $100K ARR (9 months)
- Month 17: $300K ARR
- Nov 2023: PDF.ai crossed $60K/month (3x acquisition price)
- 2024: Testimonial.to $2.4M revenue, PDF.ai $591K

**Marketing:** Build in public on Twitter (grew from <1K to 20K+ followers). Affiliate program (30% commission) = 10-15% of revenue. SEO for long-tail testimonial keywords.

**First Employee:** Hired at $400K ARR for marketing, not engineering.

---

### 8. David Bressler -- FormulaBot ($220K+ MRR)

**Location:** USA
**Background:** Data analyst, 10+ years in web analytics. ZERO coding experience. Built everything on Bubble.io during paternity leave.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
A non-coder built a $2.6M/yr business without writing a single line of code. The product started as a weekend project -- he posted it on Reddit, went to sleep, and woke up to 100,000 visitors (and a $4-5K API bill that forced immediate monetization). He understood the user perfectly because HE was the user -- the "go-to Excel expert" colleagues always asked for formula help.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Sept 2022: Launch (built during paternity leave, on a weekend)
- Day 1: Reddit viral -- 100K visitors overnight
- First 3 months: $30K revenue (but $4-5K in unexpected API costs)
- 2023: Revenue matched his full-time salary; quit his job
- 2025: $220K+ MRR, 900K+ signups, 5K+ paying users

**Tech Stack:** Bubble.io ($25/month) + OpenAI API + Stripe. Total initial infrastructure: under $50/month.

**Team:** 2 people total (Bressler + 1 employee).

**Pricing:** Free (5 formulas/month), paid starting at $6-15/month.

---

### 9. Erikas Malisauskas -- Kaching Appz ($4.5M/year)

**Location:** Lithuania
**Background:** UI/UX designer since 2011. Failed at 5+ startups. Freelanced on Shopify stores and got frustrated by poorly-built apps.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
$4.5M/year with ZERO marketing spend. 50% of installs come from branded search ("kaching"). As a UI/UX designer, his apps look dramatically better than engineer-built competitors. Pricing tied to merchant revenue ("We only earn more when our users earn more") creates perfect alignment. 90% profit margins with no office, no employees, no agencies.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- First app: 500+ installs in launch week, hit #1 trending
- First paid app: $1K MRR within 4 months, grew to $6.5K MRR
- First exit: Sold at $6.7K MRR for $250K
- Current: Kaching Bundles at $100K+ MRR, total $4.5M/year

**How He Found Users:**
1. Analyzed Shopify App Store for low-competition niches (only 2 competitors with <30 reviews)
2. Built and launched first app in 2 weeks
3. Launched FREE to maximize installs
4. Got 1,000 users in first month through manual Facebook group outreach
5. Perfect 5.0-star rating through obsessive customer support
6. Added paid plans only after building substantial free user base

**Tech Stack:** Ruby on Rails + React + PostgreSQL + Heroku (migrating newer apps to Remix/TypeScript). Storefront: Svelte.

**Pricing:** $14.99 Basic, $29 Scale, $59.99 Premium. Tied to merchant revenue.

**Key Advice:** "You will never be free with a VC over your head."

---

### 10. Gil Hildebrand -- Subscribr ($62K+/month)

**Location:** USA
**Age:** 41
**Background:** 25+ years coding. Was CTO of Seth Godin's Squidoo (2M+ daily visitors, acquired). Founded Gilded (raised $7M VC).

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Presold $20K from a 1,000-person email list BEFORE writing a single line of code. His strategy: analyze 400+ YouTube videos from a popular creator, post the breakdown on X (got 80K views), build a waitlist, then presell tiered lifetime subscriptions. He deliberately selected a "Goldilocks market" -- big enough for $1M but too small to attract VC-backed competitors.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Jan 2024: Started building audience with video analysis tweets
- Apr 2024: Public launch (already had $20K+ from presale)
- 100 days post-launch: $10K MRR
- Current: $62K+/month, 4,000+ customers, on track for $1M ARR

**Tech Stack:** Laravel + Livewire, single DigitalOcean droplet, Stripe.

**Pricing:** ~$249/month premium positioning. Multiple tiers.

**Key Quote:** "A $1M profitable solo business can outperform a $50M VC-backed company in actual founder wealth."

---

### 11. Jon Yongfook -- Bannerbear ($1M ARR)

**Location:** Singapore
**Background:** Asian Head of Digital Product & Design at Aviva. Director roles at Cookpad, Glamour Sales. Left corporate in 2018.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Reached $1M ARR on Rails 6 and jQuery. Strict "one week coding / one week marketing" cadence that he credits for all his growth. Built FREE tools (certificate generators, tweet image makers) as SEO magnets that became top Google entry points. The API-first pivot (from Shopify app to REST API) fundamentally changed the growth trajectory. "Price as a painkiller for business value, not as a cheap commodity."

**Revenue Timeline (Year by Year):**
- 2020: $24,200
- 2021: $327,100
- 2022: $586,600
- 2023: $630,000
- 2024: $991,400 (596 customers)
- Sept 2025: Reached $1M ARR

**How He Found Users:**
- "12 Startups in 12 Months" challenge (7 products, all failed, but learned shipping speed)
- Started as Shopify App, pivoted to API based on user feedback
- Free tools for SEO (certificate generators, tweet image generators)
- Developer tutorials (ffmpeg, Puppeteer, webhooks)
- Integration partnerships (Zapier, Make, Airtable)

**Key Advice:** "Use the same tech as your last project. Starting a new business is the worst time to learn new tech." And: "The more documentation I wrote, the more conversions I got."

---

### 12. Aurelio Volle -- WP Umbrella ($110K MRR, $1.3M ARR)

**Location:** French Alps (between Lyon and Briancon)
**Background:** 7 years in EU lobbying and web accessibility. First tech venture at age 14 (2006). Co-founded with childhood friend Thomas Deneulin (CTO).

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
WordCamp sponsorships = highest ROI customer acquisition channel. In a niche (WordPress agencies) where trust is everything, face-to-face community events beat all digital marketing. Pricing at $1.49/month per website hasn't changed since launch -- customers love the stability. Strategic investment from WP Rocket/Imagify founders gave credibility without VC strings.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- July 2021: $0 (founded)
- Jan 2022: WP Rocket founders invested
- Jan 2023: $7K MRR
- Dec 2023: $25K MRR (248% growth)
- Sept 2024: $83K MRR ($1M ARR)
- Dec 2025: $110K MRR ($1.3M ARR, 67% YoY growth)

**Metrics:** 5,196 premium users, 50K+ active installations, 1-2% monthly churn, team of 7.

**Marketing:** Word-of-mouth + WordCamp sponsorships + partnerships (Cloudways, Yoast, Elementor, Patchstack). Public roadmap on Canny increased user engagement significantly.

**Key Advice:** "Nothing beats human face-to-face interactions." And: "Unremarkable-feeling years of consistent execution often represent genuine progress."

---

### 13. Nevo David -- Postiz ($14.2K/month)

**Location:** Tel Aviv, Israel
**Background:** Full-stack dev, 10+ years experience. Previously Head of Growth at Novu (grew GitHub repo to 20K+ stars in 2 years).

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Open-source as the marketing channel. The self-hosted option creates trust that closed-source competitors can't match. 26.5K GitHub stars translated to 4.79M Docker downloads. Hit #1 Product of Day, Week, AND Month on Product Hunt simultaneously. Spent $3K/month for 4 months on SEO with zero results -- switching to open-source distribution changed everything.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Early 2024: Development started
- Sept 2024: Open-source launch
- Jan 2025: $2K MRR (~4 months post-launch)
- July 2025: $6.5K MRR

**How He Found Users:**
- Reddit (/r/selfhosted) -- massive attention
- Awesome OSS Alternatives and Awesome Self-hosted directories
- DEV.to, Indie Hackers, HackerNoon, Lemmy
- Docker support was critical (community demanded it)
- Monthly Reddit launches with feature updates
- n8n integration targeted developers willing to pay

**Pricing:** Standard $29/mo, Team $39/mo, Pro $49/mo, Ultimate $99/mo.

**Warning:** After a year of 200% intensity, experienced severe burnout compounded by becoming a new father.

### 14. Louis Pereira -- AudioPen ($15K/month)

**Location:** Goa, India
**Age:** 31
**Background:** Works full-time in family business (supermarkets, hardware, sports stores). Cannot code. Uses Bubble (no-code). Built 15-20 small tools before AudioPen.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Built in 12 hours during a personal hackathon. $32 total startup cost. 70% margins. Does ONE thing (voice memos to polished text) so exceptionally well that word-of-mouth is the only growth channel needed. 100 paying customers within 2 DAYS of launch from his 10K Twitter followers. Competitive moat is personal user relationships -- something large companies can't replicate.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Mar 2023: Launch (built in ~12 hours)
- First 2 days: 100 paying customers
- First 2 months: $73K revenue, 1,000+ paying users
- Steady state: $12-15K/month, 11K+ registered users, 1K+ paying

**Marketing Mistakes:** Spent $7K on TikTok influencer marketing -- total waste with zero traffic. Abandoned paid marketing entirely, relies on word-of-mouth.

**Tech Stack:** Bubble (~$30/month), OpenAI Whisper API ($0.006/minute), GPT for text processing, Plausible analytics.

**Pricing:** $99/year annual subscription.

### 15. Rashid Khasanov -- Angel Match ($42K/month)

**Location:** USA
**Background:** Non-technical. Finance degree from Baruch College. First venture was a SEC-registered robo-advisor that failed catastrophically (drained savings, maxed credit cards, deep debt). Has been building SaaS for 6+ years.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Programmatic SEO at massive scale (6,340 clicks/month from auto-generated pages). Built 8+ free tools as lead magnets (Accelerator Hunt, VC Search, Pitch Perfect, valuation calculators, etc.). Was stuck at $3K MRR for 4 YEARS until hiring an SEO expert. Discovered he'd been accidentally deleting website pages during updates, destroying accumulated SEO value. Boring database product = strong moat competitors won't bother copying.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- 2016-2018: -$130K (Richie Invest failure)
- 2018: Investor Hunt launched, $2K first week on Product Hunt
- 2018-2022: Stuck at ~$3K MRR for 4 years
- 2023: $16.3K MRR (hired SEO expert)
- Oct 2025: $42K MRR ($504K ARR)

**Portfolio:** Angel Match $37.3K MRR, Investor Hunt $4.6K MRR, Pur Social $491, Journalist Hunt $180.

**Tech Stack:** Node.js, DigitalOcean, Figma, Stripe, Klaviyo.

**Pricing:** $59-199/month (billed yearly). Monthly prices 3-6x higher to incentivize annual.

**Key Advice:** "Chase painful problems. If you find a problem people solve with spreadsheets, you are already 80% there."

---

### 16. Max Artemov -- ARTMVSTD ($22K/month)

**Location:** Riga, Latvia
**Background:** 10 years mobile dev experience. Spent 5 YEARS on a single calorie counter app that never made money.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Volume over perfection. After wasting 5 years on one failing app, built 30 apps in under 1 year. Keyword-first development: only builds apps where search popularity > 20 and difficulty < 60. Lets the market pick winners -- apps that stabilize at 10-50 weekly downloads get doubled-down on, rest are abandoned. Revenue is ad-based, not subscription.

**Tech Stack:** Flutter + Firebase. ASO tools: Astro, FoxData. Ad mediation: CAS platform.

**Marketing:** App Store Optimization (ASO) is the core lever. Paid social ads on TikTok/Instagram for user acquisition.

**Key Insight:** Individual apps are built around a single core feature and shipped within days. "Don't fear shipping: get it ready and bug-free with a single feature and ship it."

---

### 17. Andy Cloke -- Data Fetcher ($23K MRR)

**Location:** London, UK
**Background:** Self-taught developer. Freelanced as React developer at London startups. Previously sold Influence Grid (TikTok influencer directory) for $55K after 6 months.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Was one of the FIRST extensions on Airtable's marketplace when it launched -- prime first-mover positioning. 70-80% of all customers come organically through marketplace placement. YouTube tutorials with as few as 8 views still convert paying customers. Startup cost: $100 total. His "ambitious lifestyle business" vision: make a lot of money, work on interesting things when you want, no meetings.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Aug 2020: Launched on Airtable marketplace ($100 startup cost)
- First customers within days
- Dec 2021: $5K MRR
- Sept 2022: $10K MRR
- Current: $23K MRR, ~600 customers, 85% gross margins

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Redis, Heroku, Next.js + Tailwind for marketing site.

**Pricing Evolution:** $12 -> $15 -> $18 -> $24/month. At $24, support emails dropped significantly.

**Biggest Mistake:** Spent 6 weeks building a monday.com integration only to discover their API had rate limits making it unusable. Also went nearly a year without user interviews -- estimated it cost a full year of growth.

---

### 18. Rick Blyth -- Merch Wizard ($500K+ total, exited)

**Location:** Manchester, UK
**Background:** 20+ years software development. Was personally an Amazon Merch seller.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Chrome extensions run client-side = near-zero infrastructure costs (70-80% profit margins). Built free tools first to collect email addresses, then sold paid product to a warm audience. First paid extension was "super simple and super ugly" but functionally useful -- built in 4-5 hours on a weekend. Sold both extensions on Empire Flippers within 5 HOURS of listing at a 57x profit multiplier.

**Revenue:** Peak ~$10K MRR. Total lifetime: $500K+ (subscriptions + exit lump sum).

**Exact Customer Acquisition Playbook:**
1. Built free Chrome extensions for Merch sellers
2. Distributed in Facebook groups
3. Collected emails from free tool users
4. Built first paid extension in a weekend (4-5 hours)
5. Emailed free users + posted in communities
6. First paid extension earned $3K+ at $12.99 one-time
7. Built subscription products from that base
8. KDP Wizard came from users "basically begging" for it

**Key Warning:** "Avoid lifetime deals if possible -- it's a short-term high, but a customer you need to support for life."

---

### 19. Adriaan van Rossum -- Simple Analytics ($500K/year)

**Location:** Amsterdam, Netherlands
**Background:** Freelance developer. "A backend guy" who "can't wrap my head around JavaScript." Previously built a music platform tracking radio play.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Privacy-first positioning perfectly timed with GDPR + Cambridge Analytica backlash. No cookies = no consent banners needed = structural advantage over Google Analytics. Word-of-mouth flywheel: free users recommend to employers who become paid customers. Hit #1 on Hacker News for 9 hours, stayed on front page for 24 hours. The product name IS the positioning: "Simple."

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Built MVP in 2 months (working 2-3 days/week)
- Week 1: $27
- Week 2: $304 (post-Hacker News)
- Week 4: $408, 40+ paying customers
- Oct 2019 (~1 year): $30K ARR
- Current: ~$500K/year, 1,353+ paying customers

**Pricing:** Started at $5/month (friend said too low). Now starts at $19/month with Business and Enterprise tiers.

**Challenges:** Got blocked by ad-blocking lists (uBlock, easylist) despite being privacy-focused. Built DNS workaround.

**Key Advice:** "Marketing is more important than the product." And: "Don't attempt to learn too many new skills in one project!"

---

### 20. Dmytro Krasun -- ScreenshotOne ($200K ARR)

**Location:** Europe
**Background:** Developer focused on API tools.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Developer API in a niche (website screenshots) that every SaaS eventually needs but nobody wants to self-host. The problem is annoying enough to outsource but not important enough for big companies to build. SEO + developer docs as primary acquisition. Simple, focused API that does one thing well.

**Revenue:** ~$200K ARR through organic developer adoption and SEO content.

---

### 21. Tibo Louis-Lucas -- Outrank.so ($200K MRR)

**Background:** Built a massive social media following before the product.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Audience-first approach. Built the social media following, THEN built the product. AI-powered SEO tool riding the wave of "everyone needs SEO but nobody wants to learn it." His distribution advantage is his personal following -- every product launch reaches hundreds of thousands of people organically.

**Revenue:** $200K MRR through social media distribution + organic growth.

---

### 22. Dan Kulkov -- FounderPal ($10K/month)

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
The meta play -- AI marketing tools built specifically for the solo founder community. Serves the exact audience that talks about tools publicly on Twitter and Indie Hackers, creating organic word-of-mouth. Niche within a niche (founders who need marketing help but can't afford agencies).

**Revenue:** $10K/month through community-driven organic growth.

---

### 23. Cameron Trew -- Kleo ($10K/month)

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
LinkedIn Chrome extension that shows users viral post formats and inspiration. Rides LinkedIn's explosive growth as a content platform. Extension format = zero infrastructure costs. Solves a universal pain point (finding content ideas) on a platform where posting = business development.

**Revenue:** $10K/month.

---

### 24. Samuel Rondot -- Snowball.club ($20K/month)

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
AI-assisted development to ship features 10x faster than competitors. Newsletter/community model creates recurring engagement beyond the tool itself. Combines community + tool into a single business model.

**Revenue:** $20K/month.

---

### 25. Richard Wang -- Leadmore ($15K/month)

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
LinkedIn outbound automation solving a hair-on-fire problem. Every B2B company needs leads, every salesperson hates manual outreach. The tool automates the most tedious part of B2B sales in a market willing to pay premium prices.

**Revenue:** $15K/month.

---

### 26. Rob Hoffman -- Contact.so ($300K/month)

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Multi-product portfolio approach where each product feeds users to the others. Diversified revenue means no single point of failure. Cross-selling across the portfolio creates compounding growth.

**Revenue:** $300K/month combined.

---

### 27. Eric Smith -- AutoShorts.ai ($113K+ MRR)

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Rides two mega-trends simultaneously: AI + short-form video. Automates what would take hours of manual video editing into minutes. The market (YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Reels) is exploding and every creator wants more content with less effort.

**Revenue:** $113K+ MRR.

---

### 28. Preetam Nath -- SuperLemon (Sold at $25K MRR)

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
WhatsApp integration for Shopify stores -- a massive pain point in India/Southeast Asia where WhatsApp IS the primary business communication channel. Geographic arbitrage: saw a platform gap that Western developers didn't notice because WhatsApp isn't as business-critical in the US/EU. Successfully exited.

**Revenue:** Sold at $25K MRR.

---

### 29. Hirvesh Munogee -- Habit Pixel ($8K/month)

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
No-code build + SEO. Habit tracking niche with strong organic search demand. Differentiated through pixel art visualization -- a unique aesthetic that stands out in a crowded habit-tracker market. Minimal competition at the specific intersection of habits + visual/gamified tracking.

**Revenue:** $8K/month.

---

### 30. Charlie Clark -- Liinks ($12K/month)

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Freemium link-in-bio tool in a market dominated by Linktree. Differentiated on design quality and creator-friendly features. Free tier drives viral adoption (every user's bio page becomes marketing). Competes on aesthetics and flexibility rather than features.

**Revenue:** $12K/month.

---

## Cross-Cutting Playbooks

### Playbook 1: "Presell Before You Build"
**Founders:** Gil Hildebrand, Maor Shlomo

Validate with MONEY, not surveys. Gil presold $20K from 1,000 emails. Maor's first customer sent $100 unsolicited. Build an audience around analysis/insights BEFORE launching the product. If nobody will pay before the product exists, they probably won't pay after either.

### Playbook 2: "Boring Tech, Fast Ship"
**Founders:** Pieter Levels, Jon Yongfook, Gil Hildebrand

PHP/jQuery/SQLite (Pieter), Rails 6/jQuery (Jon), Laravel/single droplet (Gil). All reached $1M+ ARR on "outdated" tech. Jon's advice: "Use the same tech as your last project. Starting a new business is the worst time to learn new tech."

### Playbook 3: "Platform Ecosystem Leverage"
**Founders:** Erikas Malisauskas, Preetam Nath, Tony Dinh, Andy Cloke, Rick Blyth

Build where customers already shop (Shopify App Store, Airtable marketplace, Chrome Web Store, ChatGPT ecosystem). Zero marketing spend needed when the platform provides distribution. Erikas: $4.5M/year with $0 marketing budget. Andy: 70-80% of customers from Airtable marketplace alone.

### Playbook 4: "No-Code / AI-Assisted Speed"
**Founders:** David Bressler, Maor Shlomo, Louis Pereira

David built $220K/month with Bubble.io and zero coding. Louis built AudioPen in 12 hours on Bubble for $32. Maor used Cursor (AI wrote 90% of his code). You don't need to know how to code to build a million-dollar SaaS.

### Playbook 5: "Volume Over Perfection"
**Founders:** Pieter Levels, Max Artemov, Marc Lou

Pieter: 70+ projects, only 4 made money (but those 4 make $3M/year). Max: 30 apps in under a year after wasting 5 years on one. Marc: 28 startups before his breakthrough. Ship fast, let the market decide, double down on winners, abandon losers.

### Playbook 6: "Open Source as Distribution"
**Founders:** Nevo David, Adriaan van Rossum

Open source creates trust, community, and discovery channels. Nevo's Postiz: 26.5K GitHub stars = 4.79M Docker downloads = $14.2K MRR. Gets listed on curated directories (Awesome Self-hosted, etc.) for free ongoing traffic.

### Playbook 7: "Acquire, Don't Always Build"
**Founders:** Damon Chen

Bought PDF.ai for $20K, grew to $591K/year. Bought testimonials.io for $35K, made $80K from mistyped URLs alone. Premium domains + riding market trends = massive leverage. Sometimes the fastest path to revenue is buying an existing product.

### Playbook 8: "Free Tools -> Email List -> Paid Product"
**Founders:** Rick Blyth, Rashid Khasanov, Jon Yongfook

Build free tools that solve small problems for your target audience. Collect emails. Launch paid product to a warm audience. Rick's free Chrome extensions led to $500K+ in total earnings. Rashid built 8+ free tools as lead magnets. Jon's free generators became his top Google entry points.

### Playbook 9: "SEO-First Product Development"
**Founders:** Danny Postma, Rashid Khasanov

Don't build then figure out marketing. Research keywords FIRST (Ahrefs difficulty < 10-20), validate demand through search data, THEN build the product. Danny: "If people are already searching for it, they'll have budget for yours." Rashid: Programmatic SEO at scale (auto-generated investor profile pages).

### Playbook 10: "Community-First Distribution"
**Founders:** Aurelio Volle, Nevo David, Maor Shlomo

WordCamp sponsorships (Aurelio). Reddit /r/selfhosted (Nevo). LinkedIn community building (Maor). In-person and online community engagement creates trust that no ad spend can replicate. "Nothing beats human face-to-face interactions."

## Key Patterns Summary

1. **Speed of shipping beats quality of planning.** The founders who made money fastest (Louis, Maor, Yasser, Tony, Danny) all shipped MVPs in hours to weeks, not months.

2. **Distribution is the moat, not technology.** None use proprietary AI. All wrap existing APIs or build on existing platforms. Defensibility comes from brand, community, SEO, and user experience.

3. **Failed projects are building blocks.** Damon reused 80% of failed code. Marc built 28 failures before his hit. Pieter failed 70+ times. Tony's first project (6 months, 95% test coverage) was abandoned. Successful products launched with zero test cases.

4. **Boring tech wins.** $1M ARR on Rails 6 + jQuery (Jon). $3M/yr on PHP + jQuery + SQLite (Pieter). $220K MRR on Bubble.io (David). Nobody uses cutting-edge architecture.

5. **SEO and community outperform paid ads.** Louis wasted $7K on TikTok influencer marketing with zero results. Rashid ran Meta ads at 1.6x ROAS then paused them. Word-of-mouth, SEO, and community are the dominant growth channels.

6. **One-time pricing is gaining ground.** Danny, Marc, Rick, and Tony all favor one-time purchases for certain products. Reduces operational complexity and support burden.

7. **The "anti-VC" thesis is proven.** Maor owned 100% at $80M exit. Erikas makes $4.5M/yr with 90% margins and no investors. Gil argues a $1M profitable solo business outperforms a $50M VC-backed company in actual founder wealth.

# PART 2: Non-SaaS Tool Builders -- Indie Devs Making Real Money Without Subscriptions

> Chrome extensions, templates, boilerplates, one-time purchase tools, paid APIs, directory sites, and micro-tools. These are NOT traditional SaaS -- they're tools, products, and digital goods that generate serious revenue with near-zero infrastructure costs.

---

## Non-SaaS Summary Table

| # | Founder | Product | Revenue | Category | USP / What Made It a Hit |
|---|---------|---------|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| 31 | Jordan O'Connor | Closet Tools | $756K/yr | Chrome Extension | 30-line JS bookmarklet turned $756K/yr empire. Automates Poshmark sharing -- users search for it in INCOGNITO MODE because the platform bans automation. Wife's pain point became a goldmine. |
| 32 | Lukas Hermann | Stagetimer | $25K/mo | Browser Tool | Weekend MVP of a countdown timer. Invented "event licenses" (one-time 10-day purchases) which cut churn from 12% to 3%. Free tier logo = billboard at every event. Microsoft and IKEA are customers. |
| 33 | Guilherme Rizzo | CSS Scan | $100K+ total | Chrome Extension | 22-year-old Brazilian in Taiwan built it in 50 hours. Started at $1.99 "pay what you want" -- watched customers voluntarily pay $25. Now $80/lifetime. Previous 2 products made a combined $189. |
| 34 | Thomas Frank | Notion Templates | $120K/mo | Digital Templates | YouTuber ($2.1M from templates alone). Created a SECOND YouTube channel exclusively for Notion tutorials = evergreen sales funnel. No flash sales, no launches -- just tutorials that sell templates forever. |
| 35 | Easlo (Jason Chin) | Notion Templates | $50K/mo | Digital Templates | Started at 18 while SERVING IN MILITARY, working only weekends. Gave away free templates for 2 months to build trust before charging. 356K Twitter followers. No coding skills needed. |
| 36 | Jordan Hughes | Untitled UI | Six Figures | Figma Kit | World's largest Figma UI kit (6,500+ components, 1,500+ five-star reviews). Learned design from a BOOK in 2019, was earning six figures from templates within 3 years. $129-$999 pricing. |
| 37 | Cedric Moore | Canvas Supply | $60K/yr | Framer Templates | Went from $4K/yr to $60K/yr by switching from Gumroad to Lemon Squeezy (94% revenue increase). Platform choice = the growth lever, not marketing. |
| 38 | Edmund Yong | Easy Folders | $3.7K MRR | Chrome Extension | Adds folders to ChatGPT/Claude. 6 months to $42K total revenue. Near-zero costs (only Mailgun). Solves the #1 complaint every heavy ChatGPT user has. |
| 39 | Caleb Porzio | Livewire + Alpine.js | $1M+ lifetime | Open Source + Sponsorware | Invented "sponsorware" model -- keeps code private until sponsorship goal met, then open-sources. 72.5% of revenue from UNEDITED screencast recordings. GitHub Sponsors, not SaaS billing. |
| 40 | Jacky Tan | CraftMyPDF | $24.7K MRR | Paid API | PDF generation API built during COVID for $800. Solo dev, zero funding. Drag-and-drop editor bridges devs AND non-technical users. 2M+ documents generated. |
| 41 | Bhanu Teja P | SiteGPT | $95K/mo | AI Tool | Built in 2 weeks, hit $10K MRR on launch day via Product Hunt #1. Built 50+ free SEO tools (5 min each using Cursor) that drive 90% of traffic with ZERO marketing budget. |
| 42 | Piotr Kulpinski | OpenAlternative + Dirstarter | $79K/yr | Directory + Boilerplate | Built OpenAlternative in 48 HOURS, hit 100K visitors in first week. Packaged his directory code into Dirstarter boilerplate. 1M unique visitors in 2025. Runs operations in 2-3 hours/week. |

### Boring Micro-Tools That Quietly Print Money

| Tool | Revenue | What It Does | Why It Works |
|------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| EZ Fulfill | $8K/mo | Auto-uploads tracking numbers from CSV to Shopify | Replaces 30 min of soul-crushing manual work daily |
| SheetBest | $18K/mo | Converts Google Sheets into REST APIs | One feature. Spreadsheet = API. That's it. |
| GmailSnippets | $5K/mo | Canned email responses via hotkeys | Built in 3 weeks. Pure productivity. |
| JustFax Online | €500+/mo | One-time-payment online fax service | People still fax. SEO autopilot. Zero marketing. |

## Detailed Non-SaaS Profiles

---

### 31. Jordan O'Connor -- Closet Tools / Resellbot ($756K/year)

**Location:** Rural western New York, USA
**Background:** Electrical engineer with zero web development experience. Significant student loan debt. His wife was spending hours per day manually sharing items on Poshmark (fashion reselling marketplace).

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Started as a 30-LINE JavaScript bookmarklet that automated his wife's daily Poshmark sharing grind. Poshmark's engagement-driven design forces sellers to manually "share" items dozens of times daily to stay visible. The extension clicks DOM elements in the correct sequence -- no API access needed (because Poshmark has no public API, which is also a barrier to entry for competitors). Users search for this solution in INCOGNITO MODE because Poshmark officially frowns on automation -- so SEO targeting these private searches was the critical insight.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Feb 2018: Built paid Chrome extension in 1 month. 10 paying customers on day 1.
- 2020: $360K annual ($30-38K/month)
- 2021: $387K annual
- 2022: $414K annual
- 2023: $468K annual
- 2024: $756.5K annual (1,000+ paying customers)
- Cumulative: $2M+ lifetime

**How He Got Users:**
- Started by offering a free JavaScript bookmarklet in exchange for email addresses and feedback -- 200 signups in days
- SEO blog posts about "Poshmark automation" became primary channel
- Posted in Poshmark subreddit (until banned for self-promotion)
- Word-of-mouth in the tight-knit Poshmark seller community was massive
- Business DOUBLED during his paternity leave when he stopped actively developing

**Pricing:** $30/month ("a dollar a day"). Unchanged since launch. Value prop: saves 30-60 minutes/day and directly increases sales.

**Process:** Worked 5-7 AM daily for three years while holding his engineering day job, teaching himself web dev from scratch. Only quit when Closet Tools made double his salary. Eventually evolved from Chrome extension to cloud-based "Resellbot."

**Key Insight:** The market is 20M+ daily active Poshmark sellers, but only ~1,500 were customers. Massive untapped demand. Near-zero infrastructure costs for a Chrome extension.

---

### 32. Lukas Hermann -- Stagetimer ($25K/month)

**Location:** Germany
**Background:** Frontend developer working at a startup. When his project at work was discontinued, his wife encouraged him to go full-time on his side project.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
A weekend MVP of a synchronized countdown timer for live events -- you press start on one device, and a countdown displays on another device via a shared link. That's the ENTIRE product. The breakthrough was inventing "event licenses" -- one-time 10-day or 30-day purchases priced nearly double the monthly rate. This cut churn from 12% to 3% because event producers naturally subscribe for a single event then cancel. The free tier displays the Stagetimer logo on timer screens, turning every event into a billboard. Clients include Microsoft and IKEA.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Built MVP in ONE WEEKEND (~3 days) with Vue.js, Node.js, MongoDB
- Posted on r/CommercialAV (niche subreddit for AV professionals)
- Hit $3K/month and went full-time
- 2023: $122.4K annual
- 2024: $154.8K annual
- 2025: $25K/month, 2-person team

**How He Got Users:**
1. Product-led growth via branding on free tier (logo on every timer display = free advertising at events)
2. Bottom-funnel SEO: technical docs and integration guides (Stream Deck, video mixer guides)
3. Google Search Ads on niche AV keywords
4. Traffic: Google 50%, word-of-mouth 30%, other 20%
5. Customer interviews with HAPPY users (not squeaky wheels) in rounds of 3 calls, then implemented top 2-3 requests

**Tech Stack:** Vue.js, Node.js + Express, MongoDB. All tools he already knew -- zero learning curve.

**Pricing:** Freemium + event licenses (one-time short-term purchases). The event license was the key monetization insight.

---

### 33. Guilherme Rizzo -- CSS Scan ($100K+ total)

**Location:** Brazil (traveling in Taiwan when it took off)
**Age:** 22 at launch
**Background:** Self-taught, started programming at age 9 with RPG Maker XP. No CS degree -- dropped out after 10 months. Before CSS Scan, two products made a combined $189 total ($129 + $60).

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
A browser extension that shows computed CSS of any element you hover over -- border-radius, box-shadow, font-family, colors -- without opening DevTools. Built in 50 hours. The pricing evolution is the masterclass: started at $1.99 "pay what you want," noticed customers voluntarily paying $5-$25, gradually raised to fixed $10, then $80 lifetime license. His wife suggested adding bundle licenses (2, 5, 10 licenses) which drove significant additional revenue. Developers systematically undercharge -- customers will pay 40x what you initially think.

**Revenue:**

**Location:** USA
**Background:** Productivity-focused YouTuber who pivoted into Notion templates. Had an established YouTube presence before entering the template business.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Thomas created a SECOND YouTube channel ("Thomas Frank Explains") focused exclusively on Notion tutorials. Each video is simultaneously valuable content AND a sales pitch for his paid templates. The funnel is evergreen -- no flash sales, no time-limited promotions. Videos continue generating sales months and years after publication. His Creator's Companion + Ultimate Brain bundle outsells other editions by a 3:1 ratio.

**Products & Revenue:**

- Total: $2.1M+ over two years
- Current: ~$120K/month from templates + ~$15K/month from YouTube ads/affiliates

**Process:** Identify workflows people struggle with → outline database structures (now with AI for formulas) → build in Notion → test for 2-4 weeks → release. Updates continuously based on user feedback.

**Marketing:** YouTube tutorial channel as evergreen funnel. Free templates as lead magnets. Sells through thomasjfrank.com and Notion Marketplace. No flash sales or promotions needed.

**Location:** Singapore
**Age:** Started at 18 (college student)
**Background:** Started building in public while SERVING IN MILITARY, working only on weekends. No coding background. Self-taught Notion from YouTube videos. Skills: minimal design, presentation, productivity.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Gave away free templates for 2 MONTHS before charging anything -- built trust and audience first. A tweet showcasing a free template was reshared by the official Notion community, creating a surge of visibility. His minimal, clean design aesthetic became a recognizable brand in a crowded market. Now has 356K Twitter followers. The meta-play: he also sells a course ($149) teaching others to create and sell Notion templates.

- At 19: $11K cumulative

### 36. Jordan Hughes -- Untitled UI Figma Kit (Six Figures, ~100K Users)

**Location:** Australia
**Background:** Discovered product design in 2019 through the book "Refactoring UI." No extensive design experience before that. Head of Design at Upguard (cybersecurity startup). Co-founder of Himalayas.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Built the LARGEST and best-selling Figma UI kit in the world: 6,500+ pixel-perfect components, 440+ variables, 870+ global styles, 1,500+ five-star reviews. Within 3 years of learning design fundamentals from a BOOK, he was earning six figures from templates. His philosophy: make a product "2x better than what's already out there" rather than moving fast. The kit uses industry-standard naming conventions, making it practical for real production use.

**Revenue:**
- Nearly 100,000 users within 3 years
- Ranked #14 on Gumroad bestsellers
- Six-figure earnings (conservative estimate: $1M-$3M+ range based on pricing tiers)

**Pricing:** PRO $129 (solo), PRO TEAM $359 (5 editors), PRO ENTERPRISE $599 (12 editors), PRO UNLIMITED $999 (12+ editors). Captures value from freelancers and enterprises alike.

**Marketing:** Free Figma kit as lead magnet (each panel is a mini-lesson). Twitter and LinkedIn as living portfolio. Gumroad marketplace for organic discovery. Deep work over hustle.

### 37. Cedric Moore -- Canvas Supply / Framer Templates ($60K/year)

**Location:** Not disclosed
**Background:** Solo founder and designer.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
The platform switch IS the growth story. Went from $4K/year on Gumroad to $60K/year after switching to Lemon Squeezy -- a 94% revenue increase just from changing payment platforms. The improved checkout UX, abandoned cart recovery emails, lower fees, affiliate features, and fraud prevention directly increased conversion rates. He saves $2K+/year in fees alone. The Framer template market is in a growth phase (Framer recently hit a $2B valuation).

**Revenue:**
- CyberFolio (first template): ~$5K in a year on Gumroad
- DashFolio (breakout product): $7K+ in ~2 months
- 40% increase in orders after platform switch
- 500+ customers within one year
- Monthly: $4K-$5K from templates

**Marketing:** Twitter build-in-public (a tweet about making $6K from DashFolio got 30K+ views). Lemon Squeezy's abandoned cart emails. Affiliate program. Framer Marketplace listings.

**Context:** Top Framer template creators make $10K+/month. One unnamed seller documented growth from $2.3K/mo to $24K/mo in 18 months.

### 38. Edmund Yong -- Easy Folders ($3.7K MRR, $42K+ total)

**Location:** Not disclosed
**Background:** Developer who identified a gap in ChatGPT/Claude user experience.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Adds folder/subfolder organization, keyword search, bookmarking, and prompt management to ChatGPT and Claude. Solves the #1 complaint every heavy AI user has -- zero native organization. Near-zero operating costs (only expense is Mailgun). Data stored locally on user's machine. Built on top of platforms he doesn't control (ChatGPT/Claude can change their UI anytime, breaking the extension), which is both the risk and the moat.

**Revenue:**
- 6 months post-launch: $3,700+ MRR and $42,000+ total revenue
- 14,000+ active users

**Pricing:** Free (3 folders), Superuser $9/month (unlimited folders, cloud sync).

**Marketing:** Product Hunt, Skool communities, Indie Hackers, Chrome Web Store organic placement.

**Key Quote:** "Don't chase trends blindly. Focus on solving real, existing problems. The key isn't to create something flashy, but something genuinely useful and indispensable."

### 39. Caleb Porzio -- Livewire + Alpine.js ($1M+ on GitHub Sponsors)

**Location:** USA
**Background:** Left his day job January 2019 to pursue open-source full-time. Operates through Wireable LLC.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
INVENTED the "sponsorware" model -- keeps code repositories private until sponsorship goals are met, then open-sources them. 72.5% of his $1M+ revenue came from UNEDITED screencast recordings of himself building with Livewire. No fancy production, no editing -- just raw recordings behind a GitHub Sponsors paywall at $14/month. His first sponsorware experiment raised monthly income from $573 to $1,560 in TWO DAYS. Within 90 days, that strategy added ~$80K/year. Fly.io approached HIM to become a corporate sponsor.

**Revenue Breakdown of $1M+:**
- "Buy me a coffee" donations: ~$5K
- Sticker sales: ~$5K
- "Sushi" side project early access: ~$20K
- Hourly consulting: ~$25K
- Alpine.js conference: ~$20K
- Corporate logo placements/sponsorships: ~$200K
- **Premium screencasts: ~$725K** (72.5% of total -- the primary driver)

**Products:**
- Laravel Livewire: Full-stack framework for Laravel (dynamic UIs without JavaScript)
- Alpine.js: Lightweight JavaScript framework (minimal alternative to Vue/React)

**Timeline:** Left job → built Livewire in first week → released open-source → launched GitHub Sponsors → invented sponsorware → $100K/year in 2 years → added corporate sponsors → $1M in 5 years.

**Key Assets:** Documentation sites (daily visitors), email lists (more valuable than social for conversions), community engagement.

### 40. Jacky Tan -- CraftMyPDF ($24.7K MRR, ~$360K/year)

**Location:** Singapore
**Background:** Serial entrepreneur, previously ventured into startups in Malaysia and Brunei. Started CraftMyPDF during COVID-19 in November 2020 after realizing limitations of IT consulting.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
PDF generation API with a drag-and-drop template editor that bridges developers AND non-technical users. Most PDF tools are either code-heavy or oversimplified -- CraftMyPDF sits in the middle. Built for $800, bootstrapped with zero funding, solo founder. Over 2 million documents generated. Also offers on-premises licenses (rare among competitors). Google Ads underperformed, so he shifted entirely to SEO content marketing.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- Nov 2020: Launch ($800 startup cost)
- 10 months: $2K MRR (both products combined)
- 2023: $15K MRR
- 2025: $24.7K MRR (~$360K annual)

**Tech Stack:** Django backend, Vue.js + Node.js frontend, GoDaddy hosting, Stripe + PayPal, Crisp for support.

**Pricing:** Free (50 PDFs/month) → Lite → Plus → Professional → Premium/Enterprise (up to 300K/month). Annual plans save 17%.

**Marketing:** SEO blog content (e.g., "6 Best PDF Generation APIs" comparison articles), Product Hunt for initial visibility, Zapier/Integromat integrations to reach no-code audience.

### 41. Bhanu Teja P -- SiteGPT ($95K/month)

**Location:** India
**Age:** 24 at launch
**Background:** Quit his developer job after 8 months ("this is not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life"), moved back with parents to minimize expenses, started building indie products.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Built in 2 WEEKS, hit #1 Product of the Day on Product Hunt with ~900 upvotes and $10K MRR on day one. When 50% of users churned in month two, he treated it as filtering for serious customers rather than panicking. Then built 50+ free SEO tools (PDF converters, sitemap validators, FAQ generators) using Cursor in UNDER 5 MINUTES EACH. These 50 tools drive 90% of SiteGPT's Google traffic with ZERO marketing budget. Also sold his first product (Feather) for $250K.

**Revenue Timeline:**
- March 2023: Launch. $10K MRR in month one.
- Month 2: Dropped to ~$5K (50% churn -- casual users leaving)
- 6 months: $13K-$15K MRR
- 2025: ~$95K/month
- Total: $500K+ from SiteGPT + $250K Feather exit

**His 7-Step Keyword Playbook for Free Tools:**
1. Ahrefs Keywords Explorer (broad search)
2. Filter by "AI" and "generator" terms
3. Target keyword difficulty < 10
4. Require 1,000+ monthly search volume
5. Document in Notion with metrics
6. Plan conversion CTAs back to SiteGPT
7. Prioritize by volume, difficulty, build effort, and product relevance

**Tech Stack:** Remix, Cloudflare Workers, Fauna (reused from Feather), OpenAI API, Pinecone, Paddle.

**Startup Cost:** ~$500.

### 42. Piotr Kulpinski -- OpenAlternative + Dirstarter ($79K in 2025, $13K/month)

**Location:** Poland
**Background:** ~20 years of development experience. Computer science degree. First online income from a WordPress theme called "Chipmunk" for directory websites. Freelanced after quitting his software house job.

**USP / What Makes It a Hit:**
Built OpenAlternative (curated directory of open-source alternatives) in 48 HOURS. First week: 100,000+ visitors. Hit 1 million unique visitors in 2025. Then extracted his directory code into Dirstarter (Next.js boilerplate for building directory sites). The portfolio is self-reinforcing -- OpenAlternative IS the proof-of-concept for Dirstarter. Runs entire operation in 2-3 HOURS PER WEEK thanks to heavy automation (N8N workflows, Typefully API, Logo.dev, ScreenshotOne APIs). 41% of code written in 2025 was AI-generated using Cursor and Claude Code.

**Revenue:**
- OpenAlternative 2025: $57,361 (516% YoY increase), $6K-$6.5K MRR
- Dirstarter 2025: $22K total, ~$5K/month
- Combined: $79K+ in 2025, $13K/month MRR
- Revenue split: 65% ads/sponsorships, 35% featured listings (OpenAlternative)

**Monetization Mistake:** Added a $97 payment link too early on Reddit and got community backlash. Waited nearly a year before re-introducing monetization.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15 (migrated from Astro), PostgreSQL, Vercel, Stripe, Cloudflare Workers for scheduled GitHub data fetching.

**Marketing:** Programmatic SEO, Reddit/HN organic posts, build in public on Twitter, community submissions creating content flywheel.

**Key Advice:** "The only real moat against AI-powered clones is showing up consistently every day."

## Non-SaaS Cross-Cutting Playbooks

### Playbook 11: "Chrome Extension = Near-Zero Costs + Near-100% Margins"
**Founders:** Jordan O'Connor, Guilherme Rizzo, Edmund Yong, Rick Blyth (#18)

Chrome extensions run client-side. No servers, no databases, no hosting costs. Edmund's only cost is Mailgun. Jordan's Closet Tools has minimal infrastructure. This means even $3-5K MRR is insanely profitable. The risk: platform dependency (Tony Dinh lost BlackMagic when Twitter changed API pricing).

### Playbook 12: "Template Empires on Existing Platforms"
**Founders:** Thomas Frank, Easlo, Jordan Hughes, Cedric Moore

Build templates for platforms people already use (Notion, Figma, Framer). The platform provides the distribution. Key formula: free templates → build trust → premium templates → bundle sales. Thomas Frank's YouTube-to-template funnel is the gold standard. Easlo's free-to-paid pipeline built 100K+ customers.

### Playbook 13: "The Event/One-Time License Pricing Hack"
**Founders:** Lukas Hermann, Marc Lou (#6), Guilherme Rizzo

If your users don't need your tool continuously, don't force them into monthly subscriptions. Lukas cut churn from 12% to 3% with event licenses. Marc sells ShipFast as one-time. Guilherme sells CSS Scan as lifetime. Match pricing to actual usage patterns.

### Playbook 14: "50 Free SEO Tools in 5 Minutes Each"
**Founders:** Bhanu Teja P, Jon Yongfook (#11), Rashid Khasanov (#15)

Build tiny free tools targeting keywords with difficulty < 10 and 1,000+ monthly searches. Each tool has a CTA back to your paid product. Bhanu builds them in under 5 minutes using Cursor. These 50 tools drive 90% of SiteGPT's traffic. Zero marketing budget needed.

### Playbook 15: "Sponsorware + Screencasts = Developer Revenue"
**Founders:** Caleb Porzio

If you build popular open-source tools, you can monetize through: (1) unedited screencasts behind a GitHub Sponsors paywall, (2) sponsorware (private repos until funding goal met), (3) corporate logo placements on documentation sites. Caleb made $725K from screencasts alone -- 72.5% of his $1M+.

### Playbook 16: "Platform Piggyback (Build ON What's Popular)"
**Founders:** Jordan O'Connor (Poshmark), Edmund Yong (ChatGPT/Claude), Erikas (#9, Shopify), Andy Cloke (#17, Airtable)

Don't build a platform. Build a tool that makes an existing popular platform better. Poshmark has 20M users who need automation. ChatGPT has 200M+ users who need folders. Shopify has millions of merchants who need tracking uploads. The platform IS your distribution.

### Playbook 17: "Directory-as-a-Product"
**Founders:** Piotr Kulpinski

Build a curated directory in a niche → let community submit entries (content flywheel) → monetize through sponsorships and featured listings → extract your codebase into a boilerplate and sell that too. Double revenue from a single codebase. Programmatic SEO creates thousands of ranking pages automatically.

## Combined Key Patterns (SaaS + Non-SaaS)

1. **One-time pricing is underrated.** ShipFast, CSS Scan, TypingMind, DevUtils, Notion templates, Figma kits -- all prove that one-time purchases can generate millions. Not everything needs to be a subscription.

2. **Chrome extensions are money printers.** Near-zero costs, 70-80% margins, built-in distribution via Chrome Web Store. Jordan O'Connor ($756K/yr), CSS Scan ($100K+), Easy Folders ($42K in 6 months), Closet Tools ($2M+ lifetime). The catch: platform dependency risk.

3. **Templates are the new SaaS.** Thomas Frank ($2.1M from Notion templates), Easlo ($600K/yr), Jordan Hughes (six figures from Figma), Cedric Moore ($60K/yr from Framer). No backend, no servers, no support tickets. Pure digital goods with 90%+ margins.

4. **The "engineering as marketing" strategy works.** Build 50 free tiny tools that each target a keyword with difficulty < 10. Each tool has a CTA to your paid product. Bhanu Teja does this in 5 minutes per tool using Cursor. Zero marketing budget, 90% of traffic from these tools.

5. **Platform choice matters more than you think.** Cedric Moore saw a 94% revenue increase just by switching from Gumroad to Lemon Squeezy. Tony Dinh saw 1,300% MRR increase switching to Lemon Squeezy. Checkout UX, abandoned cart emails, and fee structures directly impact revenue.

6. **The sponsorware model is an untapped goldmine for open-source devs.** Caleb Porzio proved you can make $1M+ from GitHub Sponsors alone. The formula: build beloved open-source tools → create unedited screencasts → put behind $14/month paywall → add corporate sponsors. No SaaS billing needed.

7. **Match pricing to usage patterns.** Stagetimer's event licenses (one-time 10-day purchase) cut churn from 12% to 3%. CSS Scan's lifetime license removes subscription fatigue. Don't force monthly billing on users who use your tool sporadically.

8. **Your wife's suggestion might be the best business advice.** Guilherme Rizzo's wife suggested bundle licenses -- drove significant revenue. Jordan O'Connor's wife's Poshmark pain point became a $756K/yr business. Lukas Hermann's wife encouraged him to go full-time. Spouses understand real problems.
